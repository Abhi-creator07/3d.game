In the field of interactive gaming, the creation of immersive and adaptive
environments can make all the difference for a player. This project aims
to develop an AI-driven Role-Playing Game using Unity, demonstrating
how artificial intelligence can be applied to enhance player engagement.
The game's unique selling point is its intelligent NPCs, which use
advanced AI techniques to navigate the game world, interact with players,
and dynamically change their behaviors based on real-time events.
Finite State Machines, at the heart of NPCs, manage their decision-making
logic. FSMs can then transition between states of attacking, defending, and
exploration without any problems at all depending on the scenario. The A
algorithm* for pathfinding is integrated in the project, ensuring that NPCs
can navigate through complex environments efficiently, avoiding obstacles,
and dynamically adapt routes if there are changes in the game terrain.
A unique feature of the project is its application of machine learning
techniques, allowing the game to analyze a player's gameplay style, whether
aggressive, defensive, or exploratory, and adapt NPC strategies accordingly.
For example, NPCs might be more coordinated in attacks on players who
prefer playing alone or increase defensive measures on persistent aggressors.
This makes each playthrough different and challenging, hence making the
game more replayable.
