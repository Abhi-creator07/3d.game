In the field of interactive gaming, the creation of immersive and adaptive
environments can make all the difference for a player. This project aims
to develop an AI-driven Role-Playing Game using Unity, demonstrating
how artificial intelligence can be applied to enhance player engagement.
The game's unique selling point is its intelligent NPCs, which use
advanced AI techniques to navigate the game world, interact with players,
and dynamically change their behaviors based on real-time events.
Finite State Machines, at the heart of NPCs, manage their decision-making
logic. FSMs can then transition between states of attacking, defending, and
exploration without any problems at all depending on the scenario. The A
algorithm* for pathfinding is integrated in the project, ensuring that NPCs
can navigate through complex environments efficiently, avoiding obstacles,
and dynamically adapt routes if there are changes in the game terrain.
